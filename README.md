Experimental analysis of ARM CCI-400 in Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC. Stress testing with 100K iterations proves complete cache incoherence, measures 60ns/cache-line overhead, and predicts 4-10× speedup with functional hardware coherence. Includes kernel module methodology and complete prerequisite documentation.
